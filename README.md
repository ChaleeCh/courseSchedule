# Best Time To Meet for Data Analysis Course 
This is a small project I did recently to try and figure out the best time to meet my learners for the data analysis course I created. This came about because of the severe power cuts we were experiencing in my country (up to 12hrs load shedding) which made it very difficult for me to conduct the classes. So I asked my students to fill out a form with different times when they had access to power and would be available to attend class. I then decided to do the analysis in Python as a way to practice my skills.  


The analysis was successfull  and clearly showed the best time for me to schedule the classes. I included the python notebook with the raw code and a picture of the visuaization that shows the final result of my analysis.
